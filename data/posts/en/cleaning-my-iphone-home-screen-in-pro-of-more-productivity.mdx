I know that I spend too much time in social media apps. Twitter and Instagram are my nicotine and the same way I quit smoking 10 years ago I need to stop wasting time in social media and put that time in learning more about things that makes me better personally and professionlly.

[Social media apps are 'deliberately' addictive to users](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44640959) and they do that for the sake of profit which means they are not going to change is up to us do something to detox from them.

If you watch [The Social Dilemma](https://www.netflix.com/title/81254224) in Netflix at the end the ex engineers from Google, Facebook and Twitter recommend that you need to disable notifications, that's the first step so I did, but I did more.

### My new home screen

The first thing after upgrade to iOS 14 was clean my homescreen which now looks like this:

1. Remove all the Social Media apps from the screen, those red dots badges were unavoidable to ble because I see them all the time by just look at my phone.
2. Send all apps to the App Library, so I have to swipe or search for them.
3. Add Books.app, a constant reminder of the books I have on my phone ready to be read.
4. Add a widget stack with the most relevant information:
    - Battery
    - Files
    - Reminders
    - Calendar
    - Google Search
5. Photo widgets for happiness
6. [Mindful Affirmations](https://www.mindfulaffirmations.app/) my source to a more positive mindset.

### App Limits
I set a 2 hours daily limit (looking to set it to 1 hour) to all my social media apps.

### The goal
Simple, less screen time and/or more quality screen time, meaning more time learning and reading that liking memes. This week my average was 3:22 a day... let's try to bing that down to 2 hours.

### Conclusion
Is on us to stop wasting our time in things that will not bring anything good to our lives.
