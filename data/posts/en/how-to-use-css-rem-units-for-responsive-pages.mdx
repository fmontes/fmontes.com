CSS has many units of measurement, some absolute (px) and some relative (rem). Here's how to use rem to make your page responsive.

## What is the rem unit?

It stands for "root em" and is a relative unit based on the font size of the "root element" and by root element we mean the `<html>` element.

## How does it work?

Most browsers set the default `font-size` of the `html` element to `16px`. So if you set any CSS property to `1rem` it is the equivalent of making `16px`.

Let's see an example, let's set the `font-size` to `10px` in the `html` element (the root element)

```css
html {
    font-size: 10px;
}

h1 {
    font-size: 4rem; /* 10 * 4 = 40px */
}

main {
    width: 60rem; /* 60 * 10 = 600px  */
}
```

If we put `10px` in our root element, `2rem` equals `20px`, `7rem` equals `70px` and so on.

## What's the point?

Using `rem` in all units of your CSS allows you to increase the size of your page (either by layout change or screen size) by simply increasing or decreasing the `font-size` in the `html` element.

Increasing the size of your page to take advantage of the most available space is to offer your users a better visual experience and accessibility to your page.

```css
html {
    font-size: 16px;
}

@media only screen and (min-width: 720px) {
    html {
        font-size: 18px;
    }
}

@media only screen and (min-width: 960px) {
    html {
        font-size: 20px;
    }
}

@media only screen and (min-width: 1240px) {
    html {
        font-size: 24px;
    }
}

h1 {
    font-size: 3.5rem; /* 56px, 63px, 70px o 84px */
}

h2 {
    font-size: 2.5rem; /* 40px, 45px, 50px, 60px */
}

h3 {
    font-size: 2rem; /* 32px, 36px, 40px, 48px */
}
```

Using media queries we can increase or decrease the `font-size` of the `html.` Then use `rem` in the `font-size` and `width` to make better use of the available space on the screen.

## Conclusion

CSS gives us many tools to make our pages responsive but `rem` is one of the most important as it allows you to scale your page relatively to the single `html` (root) element of the page.
