Sure, here is the translation of the markdown text to English:

Surely while working on frontend projects using node and npm, you have come across the minmatch pattern without knowing it, today I am going to explain how it works and how to make better use of it.

The minmatch pattern is a **`string`** that contains a series of rules which are used to find or filter file names, folders or other strings.

Example: **`*.js`** will find all strings that end with **`.js`** such as **`main.js`**.

## **Some examples**

With minmatch pattern, the possibilities are almost endless, but here are some common examples:

1. **`"*.txt"`** - any string that ends in ".txt", such as "example.txt" or "sample.txt".
2. **`"folder/*.js"`** - Any **`.js`** file inside the **`folder`** folder
3. **`"folder/**/*.js"`** - Any **`.js`** file inside the **`folder`** folder and subfolders.
4. **`"!important.txt"`** - string that is exactly "important.txt"
5. **`"**/*.{js,css,html}"`** - Any .js, .css, .html file in the current folder and subfolders
6. **`"folder/[abc]*.txt"`** - Any file that starts with "a", "b" or "c" and ends with ".txt" in the folder folder.
7. **`"folder/[^abc]*.txt"`** - Any file that starts with anything other than "a", "b" or "c" and ends with ".txt" in the folder
8. **`"folder/a?c.txt"`** - Any file that starts with "a" followed by any single character and ends with "c.txt" in the folder folder.

## **How to use them in VSCode?**

When you need to do searches in the content of your files you can define exactly on which files to perform the search:

For example, in this case we are going to search only in all **`.js`** files of the project, but excluding those in the **`dist`** folder

## **Conclusion**

Find what you're looking for in your VSCode projects by limiting the search exactly to the files you need and streamline that process.
