Angular offers two methods for creating self-contained components those encapsulating all their dependencies (components, services, pipes and others). You can either use `@NgModules` or standalone components. Understanding both is vital for working with all Angular projects, old and new.


## Before: Using `@NgModules`
In the old approach, Angular webapps were built using `@NgModules`, which works as containers to group dependencies that needs to work together for a very specific purpose. 

Here's an example of a component that uses services and other components in the `@NgModule` approach:

```typescript
// services/data.service.ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable()
export class DataService {
  getData() {
    return ['Data 1', 'Data 2', 'Data 3'];
  }
}
```

```typescript
// components/display.component.ts
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { DataService } from '../services/data.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-display',
  template: `
    <div *ngFor="let item of data">{{ item }}</div>
  `,
})
export class DisplayComponent implements OnInit {
  data: string[];

  constructor(private dataService: DataService) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.data = this.dataService.getData();
  }
}
```

```typescript
// modules/display.component.module.ts
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { DisplayComponent } from './components/display.component';
import { DataService } from './services/data.service';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [DisplayComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule],
  providers: [DataService],
  exports: [DisplayComponent],
})
export class DisplayComponentModule {}
```

### Why We Needed `@NgModules`
With this approach, you can import `DisplayComponentModule` into other modules and use the `DisplayComponent` in the template without having to import the `DataService` every time.

`@NgModule` was the solution to group related code, manage dependency injection and facilitate lazy loading. Angular developers hated `@NgModule` because it was a lot of boilerplate code, honestly it wasn't that big of a deal for me.

**Note:** The `exports` property in the `@NgModule` decorator is used to make the `DisplayComponent` available for use in the templates of any component that is part of an `@NgModule`.

## After: Using Standalone Components
In Angular 14, [standalone components were introduced](https://blog.angular.dev/angular-v14-is-now-available-391a6db736af), which is a much simpler way to create self-contained components.

Standalone components can now **declare their own dependencies** without the need of an extra file for the `@NgModule`. 

Here's how the same example looks with standalone components:

```typescript
// services/data.service.ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable()
export class DataService {
  getData() {
    return ['Data 1', 'Data 2', 'Data 3'];
  }
}
```

```typescript
// components/display.component.ts
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { DataService } from '../services/data.service';
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';

@Component({
  standalone: true,
  imports: [CommonModule],
  providers: [DataService],
  selector: 'app-display',
  template: `
    <div *ngFor="let item of data">{{ item }}</div>
  `,
})
export class DisplayComponent implements OnInit {
  data: string[];

  constructor(private dataService: DataService) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.data = this.dataService.getData();
  }
}
```

As you can see, the `DisplayComponent` now declares its own dependencies for `DataService` and use the `standalone: true` property which tells Angular that this component is a standalone component.

And now you can import the `DisplayComponent` directly into other components `imports` array without the need of an extra module file.

## Understanding Both Approaches
Ok Freddy, but if the `@NgModule` is no longer needed why do I need to learn or understand this?

1. Many existing Angular projects still use the `@NgModule` approach.
2. Transition and Integration: Knowing both methods allows you to integrate new features into older projects gradually, facilitating smoother transitions without extensive rewrites.
3. Comprehensive Knowledge: Understanding the evolution of Angular's architecture helps in grasping the design decisions behind the framework, making you a more versatile and knowledgeable developer.

In summary, while the new standalone components simplify Angular development, understand both `@NgModules` and standalone components is essential for effective Angular development.
