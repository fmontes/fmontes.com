In short, React is a library, and NexJS is a framework, but do you know the difference between each?


## What is a web app

To build a modern web app, you need at least these three things
1. A **component library** to display content and allow users to interact
2. A **routing system** to navigate through the sections or pages in the app
3. A **build system** to package-ready the app to be published to the internet

## Library vs. framework

Libraries and frameworks **are code that someone else wrote** to help you solve common problems while writing your application.

### Libraries

Libraries are to solve a specific problem in your app. For example:
- Routing
- Dates management
- Transform data

#### Some popular JavaScript libraries:
- date-fns: Modern JavaScript date utility library
- Ramda: A practical, functional library for JavaScript programmers.
- Parsley: the ultimate JavaScript form validation library

### Frameworks
It **can be everything you use** to develop your web app. Typically is a collection of libraries that work together in some opinionated way to help you build a fully functioning app.

#### Some popular JavaScript frameworks
- Angular: provide routing, fetching data, components, testing, and more
- Nuxt.js: same as Next.js but instead of Reactjs, uses Vue
- Express.js: is NodeJS framework for the server

## Reactjs vs. Nextjs
React is a **JavaScript library** that helps you to build user interfaces using components as building blocks.

**Reactjs do one part** of all the web app, which is to build UI components to show content.

**NextJS is a framework** with a set of libraries that work together to build a web app, and one of those libraries is Reactjs.

> React is used by Nextjs not only to create components in the UI but to build full pages.

### Other libraries used by Nextjs are:
- next/router for routing and navigation
- next/link a component that allows our web app to link pages and lazy load data
- next/image a component to load images into the pages in the most performant way

## Conclusion
Nextjs as a framework allows you to use React library to build pages and UI for your web app.

Reactjs as a library is part of a framework, the UI components part.
