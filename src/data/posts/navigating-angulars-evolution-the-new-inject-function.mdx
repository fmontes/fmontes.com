Angular services or "injectables" are one of the best features of Angular it allows to encapsulate reusable functionality, such as data fetching, logging, or authentication.

Angular 14 introduced exciting features, including the `inject()` function that replace the traditional constructor injection.

## Before: Using Constructor Injection

The traditional method was that dependencies are injected via the constructor, making them available throughout the component's lifecycle.

**Example: Without inject()**

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-entity',
  template: `<div>{{ entity$ | async }}</div>`
})
export class EntityComponent implements OnInit {
  entity$ = this.http.get(`/api/entity/${this.route.snapshot.paramMap.get('id')}`);

  constructor(private http: HttpClient, private route: ActivatedRoute) {}

  ngOnInit() {}
}
```

## After: Using the inject() Function

Angular's `inject()` function allows dependencies to be injected without constructor injection, which simplifies the component logic and keep pushing Angular to a more functional programming style.

**Example: With inject()**

```typescript
const fetchEntity = () => {
  const http = inject(HttpClient);
  const route = inject(ActivatedRoute);
  return http.get(`/api/entity/${route.snapshot.paramMap.get('id')}`);
};

@Component({
  selector: 'app-entity',
  template: `<div>{{ entity$ | async }}</div>`
})
export class EntityComponent {
  entity$ = fetchEntity();
}
```

### Understanding Both Approaches
Ok Freddy, but if the constructor injector is no longer needed why do I need to learn or understand this?

1. **Legacy Projects**: Many existing Angular projects use constructor injection.
2. **Transition and Integration**: Knowing both methods helps integrate new features into older projects without extensive rewrites.
3. **Comprehensive Knowledge**: Understanding the evolution of Angular's dependency injection improves your versatility as a developer.

## Conclusion

The `inject()` function offers a cleaner way to manage dependencies in Angular components, focusing on UI logic. However, understanding both constructor injection and the inject() function is crucial for maintaining and upgrading Angular applications effectively. 

The `inject()` function's ability to be used in lifecycle methods, directives, and pipes makes it a powerful tool for modern Angular development.
