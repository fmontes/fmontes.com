This week a friend called me concerned because his company would hire a new developer to work on a new project.

They need to make significant changes in the architecture that he has never been able to do because of his daily work and because he has not dedicated himself to researching how to do it.

His concern was that he thinks that this new developer would get to work full time on new technology, improve the application, and be stuck as a developer and would **not allow him to grow and learn new things**.

## Slapping reality into him

1. **You have been in the company for five years**, and you have never made the required architecture change. You have your reasons, but you are already stuck

2. Your professional stagnation depends only on you and no one else

3. The new developer will need as much from you as you from him, and that's what it's all about, giving and receiving knowledge

## It worked?

The next day my friend sends me a Slack and tells me he wants to show me something. He had set up for the architecture change they need. Among other things, he said to me that it was much easier than he thought and that he saw a lot of benefits.

On the call, you could hear in his voice that he was enthusiastic and eager to work on the project. It was like talking to a completely different person.

## The smartest in the room

The worst thing that can happen to you is being the smartest in the room **(or believe you are)** because that does stagnate you, you have no one to learn from, and human beings learn from others and create incredible things together.

I have been fortunate to work with people much more capable and intelligent than me in my career, and the only thing I have received from all of them is knowledge and help.
