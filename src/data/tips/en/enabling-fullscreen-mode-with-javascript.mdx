Want to make your web page more immersive? Use JavaScript to enable fullscreen mode and enhance the user experience.

```javascript
function openFullscreen(element) {
  if (element.requestFullscreen) {
    element.requestFullscreen();
  }
}

// Example usage:
// openFullscreen(document.documentElement); // Fullscreen the whole page
// openFullscreen(document.getElementById("myVideo")); // Fullscreen an individual element
```

With this function, you can make any HTML element or the entire page fullscreen. This is especially handy for video players or immersive interactive experiences.
