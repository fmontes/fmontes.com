When debugging CSS, it's beneficial to use 'outline' instead of 'border' as it doesn't change the box size.

```css
.debug {
  outline: 1px solid red;
}
```

By using 'outline' instead of 'border', you avoid affecting the box size which can distort the layout. This method provides a more accurate debugging process.
