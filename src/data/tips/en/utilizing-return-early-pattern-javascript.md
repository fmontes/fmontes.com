The return early pattern is a popular technique in JavaScript that helps to make your code more readable and clean.

```javascript
function foo(bar) {
  if (!bar) {
    return;
  }
  // Do something with bar
}
```

With this pattern, you can avoid unnecessary nesting of if-else statements by returning early when certain conditions are not met. This makes your code easier to read and understand.
